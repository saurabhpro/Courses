## week 1

* Connectivity ( a --> b --> c)
    * **Quick Find** - inefficient union, trees are flat but expensive
    * **Quick Union** - trees can get too tall, find too expensive
    * **Weighted Quick Union** - keep trees flat, In weighted quick-union (by size), 
      we make the root of the smaller tree (in terms of the number of nodes) point to the root of the larger tree.
    * **Weighted Quick Union Path compressed** - join each root to a base root - keep trees flat

* __log* function__ - log iterator function  (the fastest of them all)
    * is the number of times the logarithm function must be iteratively applied before the result is less than or equal
      to 1.
      
* percolation - !
