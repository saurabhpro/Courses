### Interview Questions: Stacks and Queues (ungraded)

TOTAL POINTS 3

##### Question 1

#### Queue with two stacks. <br />

Implement a queue with two stacks so that each queue operations takes a constant amortized number of stack
operations. <br /><br />
> Hint: If you push elements onto a stack and then pop them all, they appear in reverse order. If you repeat this process, they're now back in order.

##### Question 2

#### Stack with max. <br />

Create a data structure that efficiently supports the stack operations (push and pop) and also a return-the-maximum
operation. Assume the elements are real numbers so that you can compare them. <br /><br />
> Hint: Use two stacks, one to store all of the items and a second stack to store the maximums.

##### Question 3

#### Java generics. <br />

Explain why Java prohibits generic array creation. <br /><br /><br />
> Hint: to start, you need to understand that Java arrays are covariant but Java generics are not: that is,  `String[]` is a subtype of `Object[]`, but `Stack<String>` is not a subtype of `Stack<Object>`.

### Interview Questions: Elementary Sorts (ungraded)

TOTAL POINTS 3

##### Question 1

#### Intersection of two sets. <br />

Given two arrays a[] and b[], each containing n distinct 2D points in the plane, design a subquadratic algorithm to
count the number of points that are contained both in array a[] and array b[]. <br /><br />

##### Question 2

#### Permutation. <br />

Given two integer arrays of size n, design a subquadratic algorithm to determine whether one is a permutation of the
other. That is, do they contain exactly the same entries but, possibly, in a different order. <br /><br />

##### Question 3

#### Dutch national flag. <br />

Given an array of n buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue pebble, sort them by color. The allowed operations
are: <br />

* swap(i, j) :  swap the pebble in bucket i with the pebble in bucket j. <br />
* color(i) :  determine the color of the pebble in bucket i. <br />

The performance requirements are as follows: <br />

* At most n calls to color(). <br />
* At most n calls to swap(). <br />
* Constant extra space. <br />
